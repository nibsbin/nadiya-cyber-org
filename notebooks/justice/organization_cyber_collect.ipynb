The primary responsibility for cybersecurity governance in Albania is assigned to specialized bodies such as the National Authority for Cyber Security (AKCESK), which carries out risk assessments, incident response, awareness-raising, and coordination with critical infrastructure operators and international bodies[1][2]. These documents detail tasks such as running conformity assessments, managing incident registers, and conducting continuous checks and simulations, none of which are attributed to the Ministry of Justice[1][2]. There is also no evidence in Albanian policy papers or recent annual monitoring reports that the Ministry of Justice hosts a national CERT/CSIRT/CIRT, leads or is a formal member of a cybersecurity committee, or oversees information security standards[1][2][4].
